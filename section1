1.	Kimchi is a preparation of fermented vegetables through a "lactic" fermentation process in the style of sauerkraut, in the traditional Korean manner. Kimchi is, with rice, the foundation of Korean food, or a meal (even a light meal) as one without the other is unthinkable. This is equally true during the six months of the year in Korea when fresh vegetables are available and accompany the meal alongside Kimchi.

Since I learned how to prepare Kimchi, this has become a quotidian ingredient of my food and it is rare that I don't have one or several pots of Kimchi at my disposal. The advantages of Kimchi are numerous and evident. Prepared with care, it is of an exquisite taste, refreshing in the summer and stimulating in all seasons. Fermentation adds new qualities, adding to those of fresh vegetables, easing digestion and constituting an irreplacable intestinal regulator; there is no counterindication even for people who are ill, on the contrary; nevertheless in certain cases one abstains from strongly spiced Kimchi. Requiring an (indespensable) minimum of skill, the preparation of Kimchi is of the most simple, and in several hours of preparatory work of the most agreeable sort, one has at one's disposal vegetables ready to be eaten without any further preparation (...unreadable) for weeks, up to months. (In Korea, familial Kimchi for winter is prepared in the month of September and constitues the provision of consumptible vegetables for the six months of Korean winter, which is quite rigorous.) It is a food that is of little cost, as one can arrange oneself to make the preparation with such vegetables as one has at one's disposal during times of abundance.
